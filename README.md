# Control of stepper motor with Arduino

The material needed for this project is:
* Arduino Mega or Arduino Uno
* Adafruit MotorShield v2.3: DC Motor Stepper and Servo Control for Arduino.
* Power supplier

## 1. Instalation needed.

We have to install in the Arduino IDE the library for the Motorshield Adafruit shield. For that, we can download from the next [link](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Motor_Shield_V2_Library/archive/master.zip).

## 2. Electronic conection.
